  "Backstory": "Elara was orphaned as a child when her human father and elven mother were killed during a bandit raid on their village. She was taken in by a kindly priest of Selûne at a nearby temple, where she discovered her calling to serve the Moonmaiden. For twenty years she studied the healing arts and learned to channel divine magic. When rumors of a darkness spreading through the Sword Coast reached the temple, Elara felt Selûne's call to venture forth and bring light to those in shadow. She carries her adoptive father's silver holy symbol and prays each night that her actions honor both her departed parents and her divine patron.",
